# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game where a human player can play against the computer. The computer uses a defensive strategy to block the user's winning moves.

## Features

- Play against the computer with a defensive AI strategy
- Reset the game to play again
- Visual indication of the winner or if the game ends in a tie

## Live Demo

## How to Play

1. The user starts the game by clicking on any box to place their "X".
2. The computer will automatically make its move as "O".
3. The game continues with the user and the computer taking turns.
4. The game will announce the winner once there is a winning combination or if the game ends in a tie.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

- The game board is a 3x3 grid of boxes.
- The user starts as "X" and the computer is "O".
- The game checks for a winner after each move by checking all possible winning combinations.
- If all boxes are filled and there is no winner, the game declares a tie.
- The computer uses a defensive strategy to block the user's winning moves.
